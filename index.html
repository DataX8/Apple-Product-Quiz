<p>Mac is designed to be easy to learn and use — so you can do more than you ever imagined. You’ll feel right at home on Mac, with many of the same features and apps as iPhone — like Messages, Photos, and FaceTime. Every Mac comes with industry‑leading encryption, robust virus protections, and a powerful firewall system. And free security updates help keep your Mac protected.</p>

    <h2>The Watch</h2>
    <img src="/assets/applewathc-removebg-preview.png">
    <p>Apple Watch can do what your other devices can’t because it’s on your wrist. When you wear it, you get a fitness partner that measures all the ways you move, meaningful health insights, innovative safety features, and a connection to the people you care about most. Multitasking with iPad is more intuitive and powerful than ever. Work seamlessly across apps. Use Slide Over or Split View to work with multiple apps at the same time, and even drag and drop content between apps with touch or a trackpad. And on iPad Pro and iPad Air, you can use Stage Manager to overlap, stack, and resize app windows.2</p>
